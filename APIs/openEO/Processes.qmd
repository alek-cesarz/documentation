A process in openEO is an operation that performs a specific task on a set of parameters and returns a result. An example is computing a statistical operation, such as mean or median, on selected EO data. A process is similar to a function or method in programming languages.

The openEO API allows processes to be chained together in a process graph to create algorithms. Repeated (sub)chains in process graphs can be saved as [user-defined processes (UDPs)](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/udp.html){target="_blank"} in openEO. 

Based on user's or creater's preference these UDPs can be shared in the [openEO algorithm plaza](https://marketplace-portal.dataspace.copernicus.eu/){target="_blank"}. You can find more information in [this page](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Applications/AlgorithmPlaza.html)
