## Output Image Formats

For the requests that provide image output, Sentinel-2 **WMS/WMTS/WCS**
services can generate these output formats:

-   **image/png** - lossless image format for 1 (grayscale) or 3 (RGB)
    components
-   **image/jpeg** - lossy image format for 1 (grayscale) or 3 (RGB)
    components, without alpha channel. The quality can be controlled via
    the \"**QUALITY**\" URL parameter.
-   **image/tiff** - lossless image format for any number of the
    components.

[Find out more on how the values are reflected in the
output.](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/faq/#how-are-values-calculated-within-sentinel-hub-and-how-are-they-returned-output){target="_blank"}

### Example requests for image formats:

To generate the output as jpeg, use the following example. Please
replace `<INSTANCE_ID>` with your own.

``` default
https://sh.dataspace.copernicus.eu/ogc/wms/<INSTANCE_ID>?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&SHOWLOGO=false&VERSION=1.3.0&LAYERS=NDVI&MAXCC=20&WIDTH=640&HEIGHT=640&CRS=EPSG:4326&BBOX=46.697956,16.223885,46.699840,16.2276628&FORMAT=image/jpeg
```

## Output Vector Formats

For the requests that provide vector output, Sentinel-2 **WMS/WMTS/WCS**
services can generate these output formats:

-   **application/x-esri-shape** - zip containing shape files
-   **application/json** - GeoJSON file

Both formats are returning polygons in vector format only in case when
the image does not consists of more than 10 different values. Therefore,
this formats only work with custom script layers.

### Example requests for vector formats:

To generate the output as GeoJSON file, follow the example below.
Replace `<INSTANCE_ID>` with your own.

``` default
https://sh.dataspace.copernicus.eu/ogc/wms/<INSTANCE_ID>?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&SHOWLOGO=false&VERSION=1.3.0&LAYERS=NDVI&MAXCC=20&WIDTH=640&HEIGHT=640&CRS=EPSG:4326&BBOX=46.697956,16.223885,46.699840,16.2276628&FORMAT=application/json
```

``` json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "COLOR_HEX": "FFFFFF",
        "ID": 0
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "MultiPolygon",
        "crs": {
            "type": "name",
            "properties": {
                "name": "urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC::CRS84"
            }
        },
        "coordinates": [[[
            [16.225567302, 46.698948044],
            [16.225567302, 46.6989451],
            [16.225561399, 46.6989451],
            [16.225561399, 46.698942156],
            ...
        ]]]
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

To generate the output as x-esri-shape, replace the FORMAT with
`application/x-esri-shape`, which will enable you to get the zip
containing shape files.
