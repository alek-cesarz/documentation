The [openEO Algorithm Plaza](https://marketplace-portal.dataspace.copernicus.eu/){target="_blank"} is a marketplace within Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem that allows user to discover and share different Earth Observation(EO) algorithms expressed as openEO process graphs. It's a one-stop-shop where they can either share their algorithm or use existing ones as a service.

This platform relies on standardized web interfaces, making it easy for users to access services. Within the platform, the hosted algorithms can be used through user interfaces or APIs. Furthermore, it simplifies the IT aspects of service publishing, allowing users to concentrate solely on algorithm development. As a result, users can seamlessly onboard their algorithms on the openEO Algorithm Plaza for further exposure to a large audience.


## Overview 

A captivating feature of the marketplace is the growing and diverse catalogue of EO services from different providers. To enhance user experience when searching a service, a text filter bar is available at the top of the page in addition to attribute filtering.

Each service, represented as a placard in the above image, has its dedicated page providing detailed information. This page briefly describes the methodology, expected results, and instructions for executing the service.

The openEO Algorithm Plaza also provides a self-service onboarding wizard that enables users to publish their services effortlessly. Applying [service maturity levels](/Applications/AlgorithmPlaza.html#service-maturity-levels) assigns a quality label to each onboarded service.

A key aspect of this platform is the capability to invite colleagues, friends, or co-workers to join a shared organization. This organizational concept allows users to manage shared services and allocate credits accordingly. Users can design their organization to specific needs, whether for project collaborators, a particular team, or at the organizational level.

Credits are crucial in executing openEO processes, serving as the main currency for accessing services and processing resources. Notably, these credits are shared among organizations. Whenever a service or a supported processing platform is executed, credits from the shared pool cover the resource consumption. This marketplace simplifies credit management, allowing users to monitor their account's credits easily.

## What is a service?

openEO Algorithm Plaza offers a wide range of services in Earth Observation. These services support algorithms ranging from simple computations like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to more complex algorithms that utilize machine learning and multiple parameters. 

In addition to providing existing services, the marketplace also supports users in showcasing their algorithms as services in its catalogue. To advertise your service on the marketplace, the algorithm must be built using openEO. It's important to consider your target audience, especially if reaching a non-scientific audience; you may want to hold back on hard-to-interpret options.

Once your algorithm is exposed as a service, users can 'invoke'  it with a given set of parameters. 

## Service maturity levels

To ensure quality control across the various services offered in the openEO algorithm plaza, the platform assigns a maturity level to them. This level indicates what end users can expect from the services with in terms of:

* Validation of the results
* Stability
* Scalability
* Documentation

The table below provides an overview of the different maturity levels that are applied within the openEO algorithm plaza.

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _**Prototype**_ | Service is provided ‘as-is’, with a short description and possibly a reference to what it tries to implement. |
| _**Incubating**_ | Quality of the service is documented with example requests (sets of parameters) and the corresponding output, as well as the resources required to generate that output. Allowing interested users to self-assess whether this service is suitable for usage. |
| _**Verified**_ | The service is labelled verified based on its software readiness and irrelevance to the scientific validation report. |
| _**Validated**_ | The service is validated, and validation reports are available in addition to being verified.
| _**Operational**_ | The service has been shown to be fit for larger scale production and integration in operational systems. Rules for estimating resource usage are available, or a unit cost is established. (€ per hectare, € per request, etc.) |

> Detailed descriptions of the criteria for each maturity level are explained [here](PlazaDetails/ServiceMaturity.qmd).
